### Setup
Install all JS dependencies with `npm install --save-dev`.

Install Grunt `npm install -g grunt-cli`.  This may require `sudo` on some systems.

Build the Javascript files by running `grunt`. 

### YUI
Documentation can be build by running `grunt docs`. This creates a YUI doc in /docs/javascript/.

### Run the server
Run the server using `ant server`; then navigate to http://localhost:8081/ in order to read the documentation.
